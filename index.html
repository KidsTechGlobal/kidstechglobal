                  <p>Coding for kids refers to the collection of opportunities available for children to get involved in coding. While it might be difficult to imagine a young mind learning something so seemingly complex, it is definitely an attainable reality. On the most basic level, coding is how we communicate with computers, and what we use to build and run websites, apps, video games, and more. Learning to code is like learning how to speak and write in a particular language; a computer’s language. It gets pupils/students familiar with how things work. Programmers are in high demand which both robotics and coding provide leverage on Effective Way of Introducing Programming to Students Programming can be too abstract. By having to control a physical robot and seeing what goes wrong, students learn what robots can and can’t do. They also learn the needfor precise instructions. Robotics and coding helps address the growing demand for teaching science, technology, engineering and math in schools, and how this subjects link together. </p>
                  <p>Coding provides a competitive advantage when applying to colleges, internships, and jobs while robotics on the
                    other hands provide artificial support in getting job done
                    If you possess a hot skill that many of your peers lack–such as the ability to code–you instantly appear more
                    desirable in the eyes of potential college admissions officers and employers. Plain and simple. With programming knowledge, students better understand the world around them.
                    Most of us don’t know the first thing about what makes our smartphones, laptops, social media networks, and video
                    games run. Basic programming knowledge can change the way we interact with the technologies we use (and take for granted)
                    daily and can open our eyes to the infinite possibilities of coding. Programming is fun and satisfying.
                    While programming is logic-based, it’s also an extremely creative activity. If you know how to code, you can
                    develop apps, video games, websites, and more!</p>
 
                  <h1 id="ai"><b>Artificial Intelligence</b></h1>
                  <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) is the ability of a computer program or a machine to think and learn. It is also a field of study which tries to make computers "smart". ... As machines become increasingly capable, mental faculties once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. Designing a robot to solve problems in our environment involves the innovative and creative application of classroom learning in subjects like mathematics, ICT, design and technology, science, engineering, physics, computer programming, civics studies and attitudes; like perseverance, thoughtfulness, positive self-concept, skills like concentration, imagination, problem solving skills, modeling, scientific research methods, critical thinking etc. In general use, the term "artificial intelligence  means a programme which mimics human cognition. At least some of the things we associate with other minds, such as learning and problem solving can be done by computers, though not in the same way as we do.</p>
                  <p>An ideal (perfect) intelligent machine is a flexible agent which perceives its environment and takes actions to maximize its chance of success at some goal or objective. As machines become increasingly capable, mental faculties once thought to require intelligence are removed from the definition. For example, optical character recognition is no longer perceived as an example of "artificial intelligence": it is just a routine technology.</p>

                  <h1 id="game-intelligence"><b>Game Intelligence</b></h1>
                  <p>Games that increase the intellect of a child can make them more brighter and smarter. Chess can raise a child's IQ, it exercises both sides of the brain, it increases your creativity, increases problem-solving skills, it improves concentration, it helps prevent Alzheimer's. Many kids play video games that are addictive in a negative way. Some of the downsides to video game playing are: the intense need for instant gratification, playing non-stop for hours taking away time for connecting with others, addiction withdrawal symptoms when asked to cut down or stop their playing-mood swings and agitation increase.</p>

                    <p>Chess is one of many great alternatives to video games. I have been playing chess with grade school children during therapy sessions and have observed the following:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Chess teaches strategy and this creates thinking about two or three moves in advance instead of focusing only on what the next move of your chess piece will be. This changes the usual concentration of only thinking about what is going to happen in the next five seconds. This instructs children to look beyond the first move and the immediate future. This is an enhancement to their planning skills</li>
                        <li>Chess teaches patience. After a few games, the child learns that making moves without thoroughly looking at the whole board and noticing where important pieces are vulnerable will end up with her losing these important pieces. They will learn that the lack of patience will most likely cause them to end up in checkmate.</li>
                        <li>Chess will improve executive functioning. According to National Center for Learning Disabilities, “Executive function is a set of mental processes that helps connect past experience with present action. People use it to perform activities such as planning, organizing, strategizing, paying attention to and remembering details, and managing time and space.” Chess allows children to practice all the facets of executive functioning and provides a motivation (winning) to engage in all these facets. Therefore kids who have difficulty with executive functioning will increase these skills.</li>
                        <li>Chess is a healthy distraction from present trauma that children may be experiencing. If her parents are going through a hostile divorce or if she has witnessed extreme violence, concentrating on chess will provide a meaningful respite from the pain that surrounds her life. Chess will teach them that they have a choice of distancing themselves from their agony through healthy means such as chess or unhealthy escapes like drugs and alcohol.</li>
                    </ol>

                  <h1 id="music"><b>Music</b></h1>
                  <p>Music is a form of act that uses sound organised in time. Music is also a form of entertainment that puts sounds together in a way that people like, find interesting or dance to. Most music includes people singing with their voicees or playing musical instruments, such as the piano, guitar, drums or violin. It is one of the universal cultural aspects of all human societies. General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments.</p>
                  <p>In many cultures, music is an important part of people's way of life, as it plays a key role in religious rituals, rite of passage ceremonies (e.g., graduation and marriage), social activities (e.g., dancing) and cultural activities ranging from amateur karaoke singing to playing in an amateur funk band or singing in a community choir. People may make music as a hobby, like a teen playing cello in a youth orchestra, or work as a professional musician or singer. The music industry includes the individuals who create new songs and musical pieces (such as songwriters and composers), individuals who perform music (which include orchestra, jazz band and rock band musicians, singers and conductors), individuals who record music (music producers and sound engineers), individuals who organize concert tours, and individuals who sell recordings, sheet music, and scores to customers. Even once a song or piece has been performed, music critics, music journalists, and music scholars may assess and evaluate the piece and its performance.</p>
